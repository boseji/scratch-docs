> Virtual machines (VMs) let you run software programs that aren’t originally intended for your device. With many apps restricted to Windows, using VMs is a somewhat common practice among Mac users. One of the most popular virtualization apps, UTM, has also been released recently on iPhone and iPad. Here’s everything you should know before installing it.

#### What Is UTM?

One thing that distinguishes UTM from other virtualization apps is that it was created for Apple Silicon Macs. It’s also notable for using QEmu, a more advanced emulation technology than the one employed by other VM apps.

UTM was submitted to the App Store when Apple first started allowing emulators but was rejected by Apple. Recently, the company reversed its decision, so you can now download and install UTM on iPads and even on iPhones.
