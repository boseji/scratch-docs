Windows 11 is here and with it comes new hardware requirements.  These requirements not only affect physical hardware but also virtual hardware too.  The TPM 2.0 requirement for Windows 11 is shaking the tech community, HomeLab community, and even virtualization too.  Well have no fear,  today we're going to virtualize Windows 11 with a virtual TPM chip!  We're going to create a virtual machine according to proxmox best practices and even install a virtual TMP chip so that you can test Windows 11 with your hardware and software before upgrading Windows 10 in your HomeLab or production environment without any hacks!

Bonus This guide will work with previous versions of Windows too!
