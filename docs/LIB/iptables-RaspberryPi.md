## Setup

```shell
sudo apt-get install iptables nano
```

## Create a basic rule set

```sh
sudo nano /etc/iptables.rules
```

Copy the following text into the editor:

```sh
*filter


# Allow all loopback (lo0) traffic and drop all traffic to 127/8 that doesn’t use lo0

-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j REJECT

# Accept all established inbound connections

-A INPUT -m state –state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Allow all outbound traffic – you can modify this to only allow certain traffic

-A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

# === PLACE ADDITIONAL RULE BLOCKS HERE === #

# ========= #

# Allow SSH connections from ANYWHERE (even the outside world!)

# IMPORTANT: check the –dport number matches what you use. on Rasbian this should be 22.

# If you get this wrong, you won’t be able to connect via SSH!

-A INPUT -p tcp -m state –state NEW –dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow SSH connections only on LAN (outside world connections refused)

# Note: To use this, delete/comment the ‘-A’ line above and uncomment this line.

# Make sure to set the local network mask of ‘192.168.1.0’ to your local network mask

# (check ifconfig if not sure or google for how to do it).

#-A INPUT -p tcp -m state –state NEW -s 192.168.1.0/24 –dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow response to remote ping  (delete/comment this line if you don’t want to respond to ping commands)

-A INPUT -p icmp –icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT

# Log iptables denied calls – these will go in your kernal log file. Google for kernal log info.

-A INPUT -m limit –limit 5/min -j LOG –log-prefix “iptables denied: ” –log-level 7

# Drop all other inbound – default deny unless explicitly allowed policy

-A INPUT -j DROP

-A FORWARD -j DROP

COMMIT 
```

The above block will create a set of Firewall rules which will block all access to your machine except for SSH.

## Additional rule blocks for other services

In the above code I included a marker for where to drop additional rule blocks

```sh
# === PLACE ADDITIONAL RULE BLOCKS HERE === #


# ========= #
```

Between these two lines, drop as many rule blocks as you need for your Raspberry Pi.

Here are some good examples:

```sh
# Allow HTTP and HTTPS connections from anywhere (the normal ports for websites and SSL).

-A INPUT -p tcp –dport 80 -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -p tcp –dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Alternate HTTP/HTTPS (you can leave these out if you only use 80/443)

-A INPUT -p tcp –dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -p tcp –dport 8443 -j ACCEPT

# Allow Samba access (aka Windows File Sharing) on LAN

-A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p udp -m udp –dport 137 -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p udp -m udp –dport 138 -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -m state –state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 –dport 139 -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -m state –state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 –dport 445 -j ACCEPT

# Allow FTP access only on LAN

-A INPUT -m state –state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 –dport 21 -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -m state –state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 –dport 20 -j ACCEPT

# Allow MySQL remote access only on LAN

# NOTE: You also need to disable the bind_address field in your my.cnf file if you want outside access

-A INPUT -m state –state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 –dport 3306 -j ACCEPT

```

## Installing your rules file

```sh
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules
```

This will have iptables read the rules file you made and try and load in the new rules. If there are any errors in your file IPTables will fail to load the file and tell you. If any errors occur, use Nano to edit the file again and correct any errors.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Like many Linux programs iptables is sensitive to the line endings of files. If you create your iptables.rules file on a **Windows PC**, make sure you save your rules file with Linux-style end of line characters. This is not something that `Microsoft Notepad` typically does. You should use a better text editor like `Notepad2`, `Notepad++`, `Textpad` etc. Those tools offer abilities to either save as a ***Linux-style*** text file or give you the option of setting or converting the line endings.

## Have your rules file read automatically

```sh
sudo EDITOR=nano crontab -e
```

Then enter the following lines at the end of the `crontab` file:

```sh
# IPTables rules reloading

* */1 * * * sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules >/dev/null 2>&1

@reboot sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules >/dev/null 2>&1
```

The first `crontab` line should *reload the rules every hour*. The second `crontab` line will trigger a rules load at *system reboot*. The user you are doing this as needs access to `sudo` – either a `sudoer` user (like ‘pi’ on the Raspbian distro), or the root account itself.

Use the same `CTRL+X, y`, `Enter` key presses to save and exit Nano.
