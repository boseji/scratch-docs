# `tumblerd` Problematic Thumbnail generator in XFCE

Reference to Issue: <https://askubuntu.com/questions/89826/what-is-tumblerd>

Solution:

> <https://askubuntu.com/a/399226>
>
> You can edit tumbler behavior by editing `/etc/xdg/tumbler/tumbler.rc` (destination may be different - search in `/etc`).
>
> There you can set folders where can tumbler work (i set only `/home`), and disable some plugins (i keep only `jpg` & `pdf`)
>
> Another Input:
> `top` revealed `tumblerd` as resource hog. **I disabled thumbnails in Thunar and uninstalled the tumbler package. Things are fine now.**
